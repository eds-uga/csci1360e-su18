    "\n",
    "1: In Part 1 of the lecture when we read in and printed the first few lines of *Alice in Wonderland*, you'll notice each `print` statement used a string that had used `strip()`. Explain why `strip()` was needed; or, put another way, explain what would happen if you took *out* `strip()` and left everything else the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Describe the circumstances under which append \"a\" mode and write \"w\" mode are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: I'm in a folder, `\"/some/folder/\"`. I want to create a list of all the `.png` images in the folder. Write a function that will do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "4: For whatever reason, I've decided I don't like `os.path.exists` and don't want to use it (we'll call this the \"YOLO Approach\"). How would I write code to read files that may or may not exist, in folders that may or may not exist, without causing catastrophic program crashes?"
