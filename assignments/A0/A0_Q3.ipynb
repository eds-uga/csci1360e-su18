    "But if you want, it's pretty easy to install Python. Important point: if you install Python on your machine, **do NOT install the version on python.org**. It's difficult to configure, and doesn't include any additional functionality that we'll be using in this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we'll use a pre-made Python distribution: **Anaconda**. Anaconda is basically a fully-functional, prepackaged Python distribution that is ready-built for any of the three major operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux. Another benefit is that Anaconda is self-contained, so if you accidentally mess up the install, you can simply delete it and start over."
