    "Sometimes, one loop over a list of numbers isn't enough. Sometimes you have to a level deeper (*inception BWAAAAA*).\n",

    "In the function below, write code to create a list of *tuples* (yes; each element of the list is itself a tuple) that represents all possible *pairs of elements* of the original input list.\n",
    "\n",
    "(for those of you interested in set theory: this is known as a [power set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_set))\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say the input list is `[1, 2, 3]`. A pair of numbers from this list would be `(1, 2)`. Another would be `(1, 3)`. However, `(3, 1)` would NOT be a valid pairing, because it is not unique: it's just a transpose of the `(1, 3)` we've already seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *power set*, then, would be *all possible unique pairs of numbers* from this one list.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's what the code you write below needs to do: compute the power set of the input list. To complete the example, the power set of `[1, 2, 3]` would be `[(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]`. Note that the output list itself has three elements, and each individual element is a *tuple* of two elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to loops: the easiest way to generate a power set is to use **nested `for` loops**. This means you'll have an outer loop, and inside that you'll have *another* loop. The outer loop is essentially responsible for one of the elements in each tuple, while the inner loop fixes the other element of each tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of restrictions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Your power set cannot contain self-pairings. Note in the example that 1 is not paired with 1, 2 is not paired with 2, etc. However, if 1 appeared multiple times, then those 1s should be paired. This is simply to say the element at a certain position should not be paired *with itself*.\n",
    " - You cannot use external Python libraries (because `itertools.combinations()` does *this exact thing*--definitely take a look at it once you've finished! but you can't use it).\n",
