    "# Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you'll work on a very common application of Bayes' Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Marie is getting married tomorrow at an outdoor ceremony in the desert. In recent years, it has rained only 3 days each year. Unfortunately, the weatherperson has predicted rain for tomorrow. When it actually rains, the weatherperson correctly forecasts rain 95% of the time. When it doesn't rain, they incorrectly forecast rain 5% of the time. What is the probability that it will rain on the day of Marie's wedding?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, you'll need to use Bayes' Theorem. Recall:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) * P(A)}{P(B)}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "We'll call event A \"it rains\", and event B \"the weatherperson forecasts rain.\"\n",
